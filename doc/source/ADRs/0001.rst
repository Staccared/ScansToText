0001: We use PIL images as image implementation
=======================================

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Michael Koltan

Context and Problem Statement
-----------------------------

The implementation of diverse algorithms for image processing
use different image implementation. We have to decide for one
to use in the signatures of all algorithm implementations to
pass around images.

Decision drivers
----------------

At the moment just gut feeling.

Considered Options
------------------

* PIL images
* numpy ndarray

Decision Outcome
----------------

Chosen option: PIL images. In principle it does not
matter. There need to be conversion helpers for all
image implementations that we encounter. So we take
the default image implementation for python that is
the PIL image that already has a wealth of methods,
especially a well working ``show()`` method. It is
also very easy to convert to a numpy array, that
is used in a lot of algorithm implementations.
