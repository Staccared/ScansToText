Users should upload files in various formats for the digital archivist. In the beginning we should only
support the most needed format.

Context and Problem Statement
-----------------------------

There are dozens of file formats we might encounter in archives. We should at
least support tiff (recommended for archiving), pdf (very common) and probably
jpg, because some scanners produce jpg by default. And zip-Archives
of the other file formats.

Decision Outcome
----------------

For a first go we only support pdf.
